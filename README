 Welcome! 
Spending a few minutes every day to count the things your grateful for has been proven to significantly improve 
your long term well-being in just a few weeks 
http://psycnet.apa.org/?&fa=main.doiLanding&doi=10.1037/0022-3514.84.2.377 (Emmons &McCullough, 2003). 
So I started writing down three things I was grateful for every day and it really worked wonders for me. 
But I soon lost these notes, lost track of whether I had done it and sometimes I didn’t have a pen and paper at hand 
when it came to mind. So I made this web app to more conveniently record three things I’m grateful for and 
why every day. 

Start using the app from index.html 
I hosted the version of this web app which I first uploaded to this git repo here: https://dkerhhfjudzfr.cloudfront.net   

See Features to add.text for list of things I would like to improve. Please feel free to add. Thank you :)
