<h1> suggested improvements required </h1>

<h2> Througout app </h2>

<ul>
<li> check for security loopholes </li>
<li>Add offline mode;</li>
<li>Make mobile friendly;</li> 
<li>Make app look good (use CSS);</li>
<li>If user is already logged in on another device the app will not work. to at least notify the user of the cause of the problem or resolve it.</li>
</ul>

<h2> Sign up/ login page </h2>
<ul>
<li>login with gmail /facebook;</li>

</ul>

<h2> Submission page</h2>
<ul>
<li>Method for submitting less than 3 gratitudes (e.g. 2 for now, 1 later) </li>
<li>Option for adding photo/or video to gratitude</li>
<li>Suggestions for ideas of things to be grateful for (on request)</li>
<li>Make submitted user data private - so I cant see it in firebase console by prepending it with a common pattern e.g. *********** </li>
<li>If user looses connection or closes browser after entering submission before pressing the submission button, all this data is lot. To fix this so the user can just carry on where they left off. </li>
<li> Firebase does not accept invalid characters e.g. '/' so if this is entered in the input field, pressing the 'Save' button will not respond. An error should be displayed to explain this to the user if they try to submit invalid characters. </li>
</ul>
